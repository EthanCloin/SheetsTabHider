# SheetsTabHider
SheetsTabHider is a Google Apps Script project that allows users to control visibility of tabs in a Spreadsheet

## Why Should I Use This?
Google Sheets can support a significant number of Sheet tabs within a Spreadsheet window. Sometimes, users can struggle to quickly locate and enter their desired Sheet. By hiding all tabs except the currently useful ones, a user can more easily work with particularly dense Spreadsheets.

## How Do I Use This?
SheetsTabHider is written as a "container-bound" Google Apps Script project. This means all you need to do is copy the .gs files from this repository into the Apps Script Editor in your Spreadsheet. See below for step-by-step instructions!

### Open the Apps Script Editor
In any Spreadsheet, navigate to the Apps Script Editor inside the Extensions menu.

NOTE: Google Sheets before Nov. 2021 may have a different menu arrangement from the screenshot below. In such cases, you can find the Apps Script Editor by selecting Tools --> Script Editor.
